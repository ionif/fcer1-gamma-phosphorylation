# fcer1-gamma-phosphorylation
Model for gamma phosphorylation based on [fceri_gamma2.bngl](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/asset?unique&id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003544.s013)
from this [paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12646643)

Made in BioNetGen

The model is being made more specific and detailed. It will also be validated with experimental data. It concerns fcer1 receptors on mast cells reacting with allergens and the cell signaling cascade that follows.
